2. `npm start` to start local web server
3. `npm run watch` to watch file tree for changes and auto-rebuild
4. `npm run build` to manually build the files

website source files are located in the `./source` folder and are
generated in the `./docs` folder.
This setting can be changed by modifying the `./config/default.json` file.
